# image-extractor

## Description
This program was written to easily extract all images from multiple Zipped/Compressed folders at once. It will also strip out customizable strings from filenames that you don't want in the output filename.

## Output
Files extracted that match the extension in the extensions.txt file will be placed in the output/ folder. A file in zipfilename.zip/subdirname/subdirname2/filename.png will be extracted with the name: zipfilename\_subdirname\_subdirname2\_filename.png
